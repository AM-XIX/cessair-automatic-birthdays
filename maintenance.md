# Maintenance

The tutorial had many steps, but to keep your JSON file up to date, it'll be fairly simple.<br>
**3 steps.**

### 1) Copy paste the form sheet to your second sheet. (metadata is our enemy here)
### 2) Export JSON file, name it properly
### 3) Go to this github > src > Add file > Upload file
<br>

*N.B. Uploading file with an already existing name will erase the older one.*
